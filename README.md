- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something 'INERESTING' as a Polymath I am always looking for the 'new'.
- 📫 How to reach me LinkedIn is the only social media I do.  I am way to busy for an online life.
- ⚡ Fun facts: I once held an internatal ranking of 26 for Air Hockey.  I ran an outdoor Haunted House for the YSI (Youth Science Instute).  And when I was on stage the largest audiance was about 10,000 people.
